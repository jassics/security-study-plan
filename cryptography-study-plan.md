# cryptography Study Plan

In this plan, let's assume that you **already** have some **computer science skills** (linux basics, common windows or mac os use, search on the internet, edit a file...). 
<br>
But first, **what** is **cryptography** ? cryptography is the **practice** and **study** of techniques for **secure communication** in the presence of **adversarial behavior**.

<br>

This plan has several objectives, in short :
- learn about cryptography theoric concepts
- become familiar with useful cryptography tools
- how to apply all this acknoledgment in the context of cybersecurity

# 1. learn about most cryptography theoric concepts :
In this first part you will focus on learning the **basics concepts** of **cryptography** (algorithms, keys,...)
<br>

First you can check some youtube videos and playlists, such as :
- [Basic Cryptography](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSNNzog5eyduN6o4e6AKFHekbH5-37BdV) from [Sunny Classroom](https://www.youtube.com/@sunnyclassroom24)
<a/>

<br>

Next you can check some **"modules"** from **tryhackme** (an online platform to learn **ethical hacking** and **cybersecurity** including **cryptography** where you will first need to create a **free account**) :
- [cryptography](https://tryhackme.com/module/cryptography)

<br>

# 2. become familiar with useful cryptography tools :
Now that you have **basic knowledge** of **cryptography**, you will learn about some of the **most useful cryptography tools**.

Here is some tryhackme **modules** :
- [pratice](https://tryhackme.com/r/hacktivities/practice) (-> series -> overpass)
</a>

<br>

# 3. how to apply all this acknoledgment in the context of cybersecurity :

Now, you know how cryptography works, so it's time to apply this knokledges in the context of cybersecurity challenges/tasks : 

First, some youtube playlists (again) :
- [Passwords and Password Cracking](https://tryhackme.com/r/hacktivities/practice) by [The Cyber Mentor](https://www.youtube.com/@TCMSecurityAcademy)
- [Hak5: SSH Inside and Out - Secure Shell Cryptographic Networks](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLW5y1tjAOzI3IjZWkI4Qh0GP2bPTTF83a) by [Hak5](https://www.youtube.com/@hak5)
</a>

Then, some [tryhackme rooms](https://tryhackme.com/r/hacktivities/search?page=1&kind=all&searchText=cryptography)

Finally, you can find a lot of challenges related to cryptography in rootme (another cybersecurity learning platform with possibility of free-accounts) :
- [Cryptanalysis](https://www.root-me.org/en/Challenges/Cryptanalysis/)

</a>

# Final advices : 

To finish with this plan, as I said above, you should at least create **free-accounts on platforms such as [tryhackme](https://tryhackme.com) or [rootme](https://root-me.org)**. This is useful to **learn cybersecurity** and developp **skills** and **knowledge**. 
<br>
<br>
You should create a [github](https://www.github.com) account too, to post code and **projects about cybersecurity or whatever you want** (if you don't code yet, please consider this other [tryhackme module](https://tryhackme.com/module/scripting-for-pentesters). After that, you will certainly **find content** on **youtube** to go further in **programming**, which is **more than useful** for **cybersecurity**.
<br>
<br>
A [X(twitter)](https://twitter.com) account can be **useful** too to **keep informed of cybersecurity news** and to **build a reputation into the domain**.
