# Network Security Study Plan

In this plan, let's assume that you **already** have some **computer science skills** (linux basics, common windows or mac os use, search on the internet, edit a file...). 
<br>
But first, **what** is **network security** ? Network security includes all **methods**, both **defensive** and **offensive**, to **protect** and **maintain functional** a network.

<br>

This plan has several objectives, in short :
- Understand networks and how it works
- Common vulnerabilities and how to detect them
- How to remedy these vulnerabilities and secure your network

## ToC
1. [Network Fundamentals](#network-fundamentals) - 2 weeks
2. [Network Defense](#network-defense) - 2 weeks
3. [Network Attacks and Analysis](#network-attacks-and-analysis) - 2 weeks
4. [Wireless and Advanced Topics](#wireless-and-advanced-topics) - 2 weeks
5. [Resources](#resources)

## Network Fundamentals
**Duration: 2 weeks**

In this first part you will focus on learning the **basics concepts** of **networks** (architectures, protocols, OSI model).

### Week 1-2: Core Concepts
1. **OSI & TCP/IP Models**: Understand layers and encapsulation.
2. **Protocols**: IP, TCP, UDP, ICMP, DNS, DHCP, HTTP/HTTPS, SSH.
3. **Addressing**: IPv4, IPv6, Subnetting, MAC addresses.
4. **Routing & Switching**: Basics of how data moves.

## Network Defense
**Duration: 2 weeks**

Learn how to protect and maintain a functional network.

### Week 3-4: Defensive Technologies
1. **Firewalls**: Stateful vs Stateless, WAFs.
2. **IDS/IPS**: Snort, Suricata basics.
3. **VPNs**: Tunneling, IPsec, SSL VPNs.
4. **Hardening**: Port security, disabling unused services, segmentation (VLANs).

- [TryHackMe Network Security Module](https://tryhackme.com/module/network-security)

## Network Attacks and Analysis
**Duration: 2 weeks**

Understand common vulnerabilities and how to detect them.

### Week 5-6: Offensive Concepts & Analysis
1. **Scanning**: Nmap, Masscan (Host discovery, port scanning).
2. **Sniffing**: Wireshark, tcpdump (Packet analysis).
3. **Attacks**: MITM, ARP Spoofing, DoS/DDoS, DNS Poisoning.
4. **Tools**: Netcat, Metasploit (basics).

## Wireless and Advanced Topics
**Duration: 2 weeks**

Expanding into wireless and more complex scenarios.

### Week 7-8: Wireless & Beyond
1. **Wireless Security**: WEP, WPA2/WPA3, Handshakes, Aircrack-ng.
2. **Network Architecture**: DMZ, Bastion Hosts, Zero Trust basics.
3. **Traffic Analysis**: Identifying anomalies and malware traffic.

# Final advices : 

To finish with this plan, as I said above, you should at least create **free-accounts on platforms such as [tryhackme](https://tryhackme.com) or [rootme](https://root-me.org)**. This is useful to **learn cybersecurity** and developp **skills** and **knowledge**. 
<br>
<br>
You should create a [github](https://www.github.com) account too, to post code and **projects about cybersecurity or whatever you want** (if you don't code yet, please consider this other [tryhackme module](https://tryhackme.com/module/scripting-for-pentesters). After that, you will certainly **find content** on **youtube** to go further in **programming**, which is **more than useful** for **cybersecurity**.
<br>
<br>
A [X(twitter)](https://twitter.com) account can be **useful** too to **keep informed of cybersecurity news** and to **build a reputation into the domain**.
