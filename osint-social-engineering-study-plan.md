# OSINT & Social Engineering Study Plan

This study plan is based on milestones. So, check how much you can cover within the timeline. The more you cover the topics, the better candidate you are for roles that benefit from strong OSINT and social engineering awareness (red team, blue team, GRC, security awareness).

Also, I assume you have already checked and are comfortable with [Common Security Skills study plan](common-skills-study-plan.md).

This plan focuses on **ethical** OSINT and social engineering fundamentals.

**How this connects:** OSINT and social engineering skills complement [Web Pentest](web-pentest-study-plan.md) and red teaming, help [GRC](grc-study-plan.md) and [Blue Team, Detection & Response](blue-team-detection-response-study-plan.md) understand human-focused risks, and enrich [Threat Modeling](threat-modeling-study-plan.md) by adding people and process attack vectors.

## In short

1. OSINT is about collecting and correlating **public information** from many sources.  
2. Social engineering is about manipulating human behavior – use it *ethically* and within rules of engagement.  
3. Both attackers and defenders use OSINT and SE (offense and awareness/training).  
4. Legal and ethical boundaries are critical.

## OSINT Fundamentals

**Duration: 2 weeks**

Goal: understand what OSINT is and is not.

### Week 1-2: Core Concepts

1. **Definition & Scope:** open sources, legality, ethics.  
2. **Data Types:** people, organizations, infrastructure, financial, technical.  
3. **OSINT Process:** define objective → collect → analyze → report.

---

## People & Infrastructure OSINT

**Duration: 3-4 weeks**

Goal: learn practical OSINT collection for people and infrastructure.

### Week 3-6: Practical OSINT

1. **People OSINT:** profiles, resumes, public posts, breached data (viewing only where legally allowed).  
2. **Company OSINT:** org charts, technologies used, job postings, press releases.  
3. **Infrastructure OSINT (high level):** public DNS records, certificate transparency logs, basic passive fingerprinting.

---

## Social Engineering Fundamentals

**Duration: 2-3 weeks**

Goal: understand social engineering tactics and psychology.

### Week 7-9: SE Basics

1. **Psychological Principles:** authority, scarcity, reciprocity, social proof, etc.  
2. **Common Vectors:** phishing, vishing, pretexting, physical SE.  
3. **Real-World Examples:** review case studies (within legal/ethical material).

---

## Offensive Use Cases (Ethical)

**Duration: 2-3 weeks**

Goal: understand how OSINT and SE are used in engagements with proper authorization.

### Week 10-12: Red Team View

1. **Pre-Engagement:** scoping, rules of engagement, legal sign-offs.  
2. **Reconnaissance:** using OSINT to identify targets, email formats, tech stack (high level).  
3. **Campaign Design (Conceptual):** planning ethical phishing simulations and pretexts.

---

## Defensive Use Cases & Awareness

**Duration: 2-3 weeks**

Goal: use OSINT and SE knowledge to improve defenses.

### Week 13-15: Blue & GRC View

1. **Exposure Reduction:** minimizing unnecessary public data about staff and systems.  
2. **Awareness Training:** explaining common SE patterns and red flags.  
3. **Simulations & Metrics:** phishing simulations, reporting rates, improvement over time.

---

## Books

1. Books on social engineering and human-based attacks from reputable authors.  
2. Books focused on OSINT techniques and case studies.

---

## Videos

1. Talks on social engineering from security conferences.  
2. OSINT practical walkthroughs (within ethical & legal boundaries).  
3. Corporate awareness-style videos explaining phishing and SE.

---

## Courses

1. Intro OSINT courses that emphasize legality and ethics.  
2. Social engineering awareness and simulation courses.  
3. Red team or phishing simulation courses if relevant to your job.

---

## Interview Questions

1. How would you use OSINT during a security assessment while staying within legal and ethical boundaries?  
2. How would you design an internal phishing awareness campaign?  
3. How can OSINT and SE knowledge help improve an organizations security posture?
